// SemiCOlons are optional in JavaScript but it is a good practice to use them
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let sum = a + b;

// we can define two line in a single line by using semi colon
let x = 5; let y = 15; let mul = x * y;
console.log("value of sum is: ", sum); console.log("value of mul is: ", mul);
