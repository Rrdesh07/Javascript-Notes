// undefined is basically a variable is declared but not defined yet (means not assigned any value yet)
let variable1;
console.log("value of variable1 is: ",variable1); // it will print undefined

// undeclared means variable is not declared yet but we are trying to access it 
// console.log("value of variable2 is: ",variable2); // it will give error variable2 is not defined
