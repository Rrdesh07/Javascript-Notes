// In Js we use camelCase for variable names
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

// There are different conventions for naming variables
// 1.camelCase : first letter of first word is small and first letter of other words is capital
// example : firstName, lastName, myAge, etc
// 2.PascalCase : first letter of all words is capital
// example : FirstName, LastName, MyAge, etc
// 3.snake_case : all letters are small and words are separated by underscore
// example : first_name, last_name, my_age, etc
// 4.kebab-case : all letters are small and words are separated by hyphen
// example : first-name, last-name, my-age, etc


console.log("value of firstName is: ", firstName);
console.log("value of lastName is: ", lastName);
