// we have already seen the types of comparision operators in if else conditions

// equality operators
let a = 10;
let b = '10';
console.log(a == b); // it will return true because values are same but types are different
console.log(a === b); // it will return false because values are same but types are different

// ==  -> is equal operator
// === -> is strict equal operator

// inequality operators
console.log(a != b);
console.log(a !== b);
// !=  -> is not equal operator
// !== -> is strict not equal operator

// greater than and less than operators
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
console.log(x > y); // false            

console.log(x < y); // true

// greater than or equal to and less than or equal to operators
console.log(x >= y); // false
console.log(x <= y); // true
